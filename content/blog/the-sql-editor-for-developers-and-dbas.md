## Key features of Advanced SQL Editor

With Database DevOps rapidly evolving,  application developers and DBAs are involved in database migration management. Application developers are responsible for writing SQL statements to apply schema and data change to their databases and view the query results. On the other hand, DBAs ensure that all databases run smoothly, securely, and efficiently by developing various policies and collaborating with application developers to perform the migration.

As we know, SQL Editor is a crucial tool for writing and executing SQL statements and operating databases with admin commands. Compared to the classic SQL tools, such as command line interface and traditional SQL Editor, an advanced SQL Editor for the Database DevOps team should have the following features:
- User-friendly interface:  It should be easy to write, read and execute SQL statements and browse the database schema and query results.
- Collaboration: It should support team members in saving, sharing, and tracking SQL statements.
- Security: It should provide features to grant database access to team members with requirements, protect sensitive data when executing queries, and control permissions to perform database admin commands.

## SQL Editor in Bytebase Console
Bytebase v1.9.1 releases a new SQL Editor with the following highlights:
- Admin mode: Bytebase provides Admin mode in SQL Editor to allow DBAs to execute database admin commands. 
- Database-based access control: All databases in the protected environments can not be queried by developers in SQL Editor. DBAs can configure a database allowlist to grant developers the ability to query part of databases.
- Data anonymization: The query result of sensitive columns will be masked when developers run a query in SQL Editor. It is applicable to MySQL with all types of queries, such as subquery, JOIN, Common Table Expression.
- Collaborative sheets: DBAs and developers can save SQL statements as sheets to share with others in SQL Editor. However, this release supports saving the uploaded SQL scripts as sheets to be used in issues to apply migration. 
- Good user experience: This release presents SQL Editor with a fresh look and improves the code auto-completion.

### Admin Mode

When users want to connect to databases to run admin commands, they can do it in SQL Editor Admin mode with a DBA account like the screenshot below. You can take a look at the document [Admin Mode](https://www.bytebase.com/docs/sql-editor/admin-mode) to learn more details.

### Database-based Access Control

When users want to allow developers to access some databases in the production environment, they can mark the production environment as a protected environment and configure an allowlist. You can get more details with the document [Database Access Control](https://www.bytebase.com/docs/administration/database-access-control).

### Data Anonymization

When developers query tables containing sensitive columns in SQL Editor, the result of these columns will display as "******". You can learn the configuration details with the document [Anonymize Data](https://www.bytebase.com/docs/administration/anonymize-data).

### Collaborative Sheets
For commonly-used SQL statements, you can save them as sheets and set up a public SQL script library in your team. It is helpful in saving time and reducing SQL errors. For large SQL scripts (up to 100M), you can use them in issues after uploading them as sheets (see the screenshot below). You can explore the document [Manage SQL Scripts with Sheet](https://www.bytebase.com/docs/sql-editor/manage-sql-scripts) to get additional details.

## Try it Out

With the new SQL Editor in Bytebase Console, you can run database admin commands in Admin mode, anonymize sensitive data when executing queries, configure a database allowlist to manage database access permission, and save commonly-used SQL scripts to collaborate with team members. We hope you can find the SQL Editor to be a useful tool.
